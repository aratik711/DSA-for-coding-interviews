"""

Implement a function that returns the minimum number of platforms that are required for the train so that none of them waits.

Input#
Two lists which represent arrival and departure times of trains that stop

Output#
Minimum number of platforms required

The time complexity will now be O(nlogn)
, because we used sorted lists and greedily kept track of the trains that have arrived but havenâ€™t left yet.
