"""

Inversion count represents how far or close a list is from being sorted. If a list is sorted, the inversion count will be 0. But if itâ€™s sorted in the reverse order, the inversion count will be maximum.
Given an array of n integers, find the inversion count for its elements.

Input#
lst - A list containing integers in any order (It can contain negative values too.)


Output#
inversion_count - An integer is returned after counting the total number of inversions

Sample input#
lst = [7, 6, 5, 8]
Sample output#
result = 3

The running time will be O(n log n)
, because when the list is successively divided into halves, the recursion tree has depth lg n
. At each level of the recursion tree, calls to inversion_count touches exactly n elements. Thus, the total running time is O(n log n)
