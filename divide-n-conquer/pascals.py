"""

The time complexity of this solution is O(linenumber)
, since starting from the first line, we use previous lines to calculate the current line. The loop on Line 25-35 runs at most line_number (where line_number is equal to the max number of rows in the Pascalâ€™s triangle) times at the first call to the function.
