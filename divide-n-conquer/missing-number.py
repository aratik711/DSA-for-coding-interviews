Suppose that you are given an array of contiguous integers starting from 1 to n, with one integer missing in the middle
Given a list of contiguous integers starting from 1 (with one missing integer in between), find the missing integer. If there is no number missing, return -1.

Input#
List of contiguous integers starting from 1

Output#
integer (missing integer or -1
âˆ’1
 if no missing integer)

Sample input#
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Sample output#
result = 5

Since this approach follows the same process as a binary search would, the time complexity of this solution is O(log n)
