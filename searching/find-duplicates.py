"""

A list of duplicate integers

Note: All the integers are less than the size of the list.

Output#
A list with the duplicates if they exist, and an empty list if they donâ€™t

Sample input#
  lst = [1, 3, 1, 3, 5, 1, 4, 7, 7]
Sample output#
  result = [1, 3, 7]

Since the list is traversed only once and removing duplication also takes O(n)
 time, the overall time complexity of this solution is O(n)
